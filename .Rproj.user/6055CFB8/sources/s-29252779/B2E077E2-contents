# UBC Course Planner

### â€” A Virtual Academic Adviser for *Computer Science* Specializations

As many courses in UBC have pre-requisites or co-requisites, sometimes it is difficult for student to well plan their 
courses as to meet requirements, time efficiently and suits their academic interests. Compared to some other majors 
where only a few courses are required for upper-division ones, this problem is more salient in specializations
 in the Faculty of Science.
 
This program is designed for UBC undergraduate students with Computer Science specialization to plan study more wisely.
It has the following functions: 

- Keeps tract student's completed courses that are relevant to Computer Science
- Recommends courses for the coming term, depending on students' major streams
- Produces a tree diagram of to visualize UBC Computer Science course requirements.
